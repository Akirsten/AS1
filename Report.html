    Since starting the Web development Module. I have enjoyed being able to express my passion for computer science with creative sites. Learning the Basics of HTML and CSS has come natural to me as I do have previous experience of building a website that is also one of my first ever projects, I’ve created with the SheCodes bootcamp being at help.

    This module has helped me to be more creative and learn a different way of how to build a website and build on what is already there. My favourite learning part would be learning more about CSS. CSS is what really brings the website alive and what keeps me going, due to the more I add, the more I see myself creating a better vision than I previously had.

    I decided to go for a sleek design with the white background and with the hint of pink really reflects my inner passion for wanting to break the gender gap for women in the tech industry which I’ve stayed consistent with from the start. In this webpage design it carries from the Homepage button through to the report page. With the Font I decided to go with the Raleway font as it gives a sleek and modern finishing design giving a firm and bold statement to the page. I would say the inspiration for my webpage design has to from the software engineering module in which I had to make a draft layout for the prototype webpage for Claybrooke Zoo as I thought it was very fitting for the webpage I had in mind.
Some struggles I kind of faced was being able committing and branches as I did run into trouble opening a new branch and adding the content for my other pages in there, but I did manage to fix it and add the content for the pages into the main branches.
