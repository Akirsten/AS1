        After completing the SheCodes Bootcamp, I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and skills in the world of web development, which led me to apply for the Lighthouse Projects Hosted by The Lighthouse Project in collaboration with Google. In this project I was able to learn more about the business sector of technology, and how to cater towards customers needs and wants, which led me to create a prototype for a website that caters to the needs of students in the university Google, where I was mentored by Google employees about the tech and business industry and being able to learn how to work in a group enviroment and communication and several business skills that are needed in the tech industry.

       <p> From that moment on, the hard work began which led me to recieve an work experience offer from the company CandySpace in my later years of Sixth Form (2023). In that work experience program, I was able to learn more about UI and UX designs, Prototyping and able to cater towards customers needs and wants.  As an End Result of this i was able to create an prototype for a app that caters to vets and their pet health.
